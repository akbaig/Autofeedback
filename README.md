## Some History
Due to the long and uninteresting feedback set by our university two programmers from PIEAS university decided to step up. 
We decided to build an auto feedback program which is very user friendly. You can interact with it through minimalist GUI and 
it does the work in a matter of seconds which previously took half an hour!

## Additional Notes:

The program can take upto 2 minutes to fully load depending upon your connection speed. 
This is due to downloading of webdriver if one doesn't exists in your computer already.
